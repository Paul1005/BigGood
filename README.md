## Controls

Default controls are as follows:
- Fire1: Left Control, Mouse0, or Joystick 1 Button 5
- Fire2: Left Alt, Mouse1, or Joystick 1 Button 4 (Currently does nothing)
- Pause Menu: Escape, or Joystick 1 Button 7
- Movement: WASD, Arrow Keys, or the left analog stick of Joystick 1.
- Aiming: Mouse, or the right analog stick of Joystick 1.

Except for movement, aiming, and menu navigation, the controls can be freely 
rebound from the Pause Menu, using the Set(Add a new key to a control.) and 
Clear(Clear all keys on a control.) buttons.

Bringing up the Pause Menu also Pauses the game.

Fire2 presently does nothing except while the Pause Menu is displayed, 
in which case, as explained onscreen, pressing Fire1+Fire2 while on the 
Pause Menu will quit the game.

## Known Issues

- Pressing bound controls while on the Pause Menu will carry over and activate when you close the Menu.
- Displayed control bindings aren't updated unless first Cleared. (They are still set.)
- It's possible to clear all controls.
- Custom Controls do not get saved across game restarts.
- Wrapping of objects across screen edges is not smooth.
- Joystick aiming feels strange and jerky, and is prone to flipping.
- Individual key bindings for controls cannot be unassigned, only all keys for a control cleared.
